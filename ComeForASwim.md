The Head of State had the driver open the door for him and got out of the armored limo. There were no cameras or reporters. Slowly, the Head of State climbed up three steps, toward the glass door of the gray, flat-roofed building. There, again, he had someone open the door for him. One of the many small privileges that one had in a leadership position, he thought. One got used to it quickly. Being driven around by others and have them open doors became normal after a while. It just never felt normal for those having to do the driving and the opening. Inside the building, the Head of State walked down long, empty and windowless corridors. He took no notice of the letters and numbers labeling the many closed doors. Instead, he headed straight for the only open door. The meeting room behind it, as welcoming and as stately as a newly renovated primary school classroom, was empty. The Head of State was puzzled for a moment. One got used to never having to wait for anyones arrival. The others were the ones having to wait for him. That was normal. Until it wasn‘t. This was the room where the previous meetings had taken place. And today‘s meeting would happen here too. No doubt. Sitting down on one of the chairs made from bent aluminium pipes and pressboard was not comfortable. But the Head of State did not want to stand. <br><br>
